# ðŸ”‘ Make your own YubiKey covers! ðŸ”‘

[Yubico sells its own stickers](https://www.yubico.com/nl/product/yubistyle-covers), but I wanted to make something more personal.

I used expensive measurement equipment to make an exact representation of the YubiKey 5 NFC's shape, which resulted in the [template you can use to make your own sticker](./Templates).

If you want more models, feel free to submit your own templates, or you can donate me the YubiKey model, and I'll try to make my own and publish it here.

## How to use

You can open the template in Inkscape, and start painting over the areas within the red cutout line.

When submitting the result to a printing company, make sure to give them both a cutout and a raw version with no cutout lines to accommodate for precision issues with cutting machines.

Any printing company that can do die-cut stickers should work.
